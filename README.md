# MemorySprout

**MemorySprout** is an educational game that transforms learning procedural programming into a fun and interactive gardening experience. Through hands-on interaction with a vibrant garden, players will cultivate their programming skills while tackling real-world-inspired coding challenges. Inspired by games like *Harvest Moon*, MemorySprout bridges the gap between abstract programming ideas and engaging gameplay by rooting them in procedural concepts.

## Features

- **Interactive Gardening**: Plant, grow, and manage a garden where each task represents a key programming concept.
- **Procedural Programming Focus**: Learn foundational programming paradigms such as functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures.
- **Visual Feedback**: Abstract coding concepts are represented as tangible garden elements, growing and evolving as players progress.
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Explore programming concepts at your own pace in an open-world gardening environment.
- **Gamified Motivation**: Resource management, achievements, and unlockable areas encourage continued engagement and learning.

## Why MemorySprout?

MemorySprout is designed for learners who want an approachable, hands-on way to understand procedural programming. Instead of traditional exercises, it connects coding concepts with real-world analogies, making learning intuitive and enjoyable. Whether you're writing your first `for` loop or managing a collection of garden tiles with arrays, MemorySprout ensures that players retain programming knowledge through interactive exploration and gameplay.

## Game Objectives

- Teach procedural programming fundamentals through interactive gardening mechanics.
- Provide a self-paced, open-world environment for tackling coding challenges.
- Align gameplay progression with foundational programming topics.

## How It Works

1. **Planting Seeds**: Represent programming structures like variables and functions by planting seeds in your garden.
2. **Garden Maintenance**: Use loops, conditionals, and functions to maintain your garden, such as watering plants or removing weeds.
3. **Resource Management**: Manage resources like water, sunlight, and soil health using arrays, structs, and basic data structures.
4. **Expanding the Garden**: Unlock new features by solving coding challenges and mastering procedural programming concepts.
5. **Visual Learning**: Observe how abstract programming ideas (e.g., recursion or nested loops) translate into tangible garden behaviors.

## Procedural Programming Concepts Covered

- **Variables and Data Types**: Represent plant attributes (e.g., growth, health) using variables.
- **Functions**: Write reusable functions to automate garden tasks like watering or harvesting.
- **Conditionals**: Use `if`/`else` to make decisions, such as determining if a plant needs watering.
- **Loops**: Automate repetitive tasks, such as iterating through rows of garden tiles.
- **Arrays**: Manage collections of plants and garden tiles.
- **Recursion**: Solve advanced challenges like simulating plant growth over multiple stages.
- **File I/O**: Save and load garden progress using text files.

## Development Plan

MemorySprout will be developed incrementally with the following features:
1. **Interactive Garden**: Build the foundation with basic tiles, plants, and player interactions.
2. **Programming Challenges**: Introduce procedural programming concepts through engaging tasks.
3. **Progression System**: Add unlockable areas and increasing levels of complexity as players master new concepts.
4. **Resource Management**: Implement water, sunlight, soil, and other resources to simulate real-world gardening challenges.
5. **Visual Feedback**: Add animations to show how garden elements respond to player-written code.

## Tools and Technology

- **Framework**: SDL2 or GTK+  
  SDL2 will provide cross-platform 2D graphics and UI rendering, making it ideal for the garden's visual elements. 
  <br>GTK+ is another option for a lightweight, window-based interface.
- **Development Tools**: CLion  
  All development will take place using CLion, a powerful IDE for C and C++ development, ensuring smooth code management and debugging.
